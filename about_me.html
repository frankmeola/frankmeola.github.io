<h1>About me</h1>

<p>My name is Frank Meola. I am a full-stack professional software developer. I am a generalist with some specialization in web site and application programming, service oriented architecture (SOA), and Domain Driven Design (DDD).</p>

<h1>Skillsets</h1>

<hr />

<h2>User Interface (UI)</h2>

<p>Early in my career I was heavily involved in graphics and UI work for many clients. While my Photoshop skills aren't as sharp as they used to be I never forgot the valuable lessons from the interaction with clients. In my experience, the goals and needs of the user define the user interface and trickle down throughout the rest of the system. It can be difficult to remember why we are adding some technical detail months into a project. By having a clear picture of the user's needs intermittent trips down the technical rabbit hole end up successful because the big picture remains in sight.</p>

<h2>Backend</h2>

<p>As I moved deeper into enterprise systems I focused more on backend system design. I had generally worked across all tiers from frontend to backend to data storage when possible. Being able to cut through all the layers at once helped to keep the coherence of the user's needs throughout the codebase and reduce the chances of mis-communication. Through experiences and opportunities at work I was able to focus more heavily on the backend and the integration of systems with some of the unique lessons therein. </p>

<h2>Business</h2>

<p>Code is not always the solution. As much as technology can change the world at the end of the day it is still a world full of humans. The intersection of business and technology holds a special place for me since it is typically why I am developing something - to produce business value. Product development, entrepreneurial opportunities, and plain old business problem solving are just some of the fun ways to apply technology to build or improve a business.</p>
