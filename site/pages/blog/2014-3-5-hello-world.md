Dear {yourName},

It's been {currentDate - lastEncounterDate} since we last spoke. How are you? I am well.

I have some interesting ideas to share with you and we have some crazy adventures ahead of us. Hopefully you are interested in seeing where this goes. I know you are already overloaded with other blogs and their ideas. I will try not to be too redundant but I can't make any promises. I will try not to be pedantic and preachy but that is tough since that's about 95% of what I have planned.

Like everything in life you and I will grow through these experiences and become wiser.

Sincerely, 

Frank
